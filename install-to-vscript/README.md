1. There are currently 4 files in this folder, written in 2 languages:
    1. `quick-install-oha.ba`t: Directly runnable script, written texts in `English`. 
        1. `quick-install-oha.zip`: The zipped file of `quick-install-oha.bat`.
    1. `quick-install-oha-cn.bat`: Directly runnable script, written texts in `Chinese`. 
        1. `quick-install-oha-cn.zip`: The zipped file of `quick-install-oha-cn.bat`.

## Usage

1. Download one of those files available in this folder, recommand downloading a `zip` file.
2. There is only one file (named: `quick-install-oha.bat`) inside the `zip`. You need to copy that file into this Steam folder: `Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta`. If you don't know where the Steam folder is, right click on `Dota2` in `Steam Library`, select `Properties` > `Installed Files` > `Browse`.
3. Double click on the `quick-install-oha.bat` file to finish installation.
4. If you see a warning `Windows protected your PC`, because it's 3rd party script. Click on `More Info` > `Run anyway`.

By doing this, any new updates to the script content will automatically available as your Local dev script. Alternatively, you can choose to create a symbolic link yourself, check out Appendix below.
